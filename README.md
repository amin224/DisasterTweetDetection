# DisasterTweetDetection

﻿Overview

Disaster Tweet Detection is a machine learning project designed to classify tweets as either related to a disaster or not. The project explores various models to assess their performance in accurately detecting disaster-related tweets.

﻿Features

Dataset Processing: Preprocessing techniques applied to clean and tokenize text data.

Model Evaluation: Multiple machine learning models tested, including Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and deep learning models.

Performance Metrics: Comparison of models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Data distribution, word clouds, and model performance visualized using graphs.

Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive notebooks used to run experiments and analyze results.
